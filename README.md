# Sentinel 🛡️  
**Ruthless Digital Discipline. No Escapes. No Excuses.**

**Sentinel** is the ultimate app and website blocker. Built to enforce deep focus, track usage, and eliminate digital addiction through sacrifice-based rules and unbreakable system-level controls.

---

## 🚀 Why I Built This

I created **Sentinel** because traditional blockers are too easy to bypass. I wanted a tool that fights back—one that treats distraction like a threat and discipline like a system. This project is part of my portfolio to showcase my ability to solve real problems with full-stack, cross-platform engineering and psychological design.

## 💡 Key Features

- **One-Hour Deletion Window**: You can only modify your block list during a strict 1-hour period every Sunday.
- **Sacrifice System**: Need an emergency unlock? You’ll lose access to your favorite app for 7 days, skip next week’s edit window, and cut all your timers in half.
- **Time-Limited Access**: Set timers for apps and websites—once time’s up, they’re locked for the day.
- **Anti-Break Mechanism**: Trying to sneak around the system results in penalties—like timer reductions or extended lockouts.
- **Uninstall-Proof**: Can only be removed during the Sunday window—no backdoors or kill switches.
- **Mental Health Whitelist**: Essential apps (safety, mental health, recovery tools) are always protected.
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Sentinel syncs your rules and usage data across all your connected devices.
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Tracks your usage and visualizes it in charts across all platforms.
